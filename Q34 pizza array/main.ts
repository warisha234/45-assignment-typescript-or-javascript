// Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a array,
//  and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza.
// • Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead
//  of printing just the name of the pizza.
//   For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.

// • Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza.
//  The output should consist of three or more lines about the kinds of pizza 
//  like and then an additional sentence, such as I really love pizza!

let fvrtPizza =['Chessy tikka','fajita,','pepperoni,']

for (let pizza of fvrtPizza){
    console.log(`I like ${pizza} pizza`);
}

// print a msg out side of loop

console.log("i love pizza");
